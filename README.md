# HSRW Submarine Team: Steering System Design and Manufacturing
This repository documents the design and manufacturing process of the steering system for the HSRW Submarine Team's human-powered submarine, built for the European International Submarine Races (eISR). The submarine is designed to be fully mechanical, relying on human power for propulsion and control. The steering system plays a crucial role in maneuvering the submarine through the challenging eISR race course, which includes straight sections, a sweeping turn, and a slalom course.
Steering System Overview:
The steering system is designed with a focus on efficiency, reliability, and ease of operation under high physical load. It utilizes a combination of mechanical linkages and control surfaces to translate the pilot's input into precise movements of the submarine.
Key Design Features:
Materials: The system primarily utilizes stainless steel for its strength, corrosion resistance, and durability in the underwater environment. Aluminum alloys are also used in specific components where a balance between strength and weight is crucial.
Mechanical Advantage: A system of levers and gears provides a mechanical advantage, amplifying the pilot's input from the joystick to effectively control the rudders and fins despite water resistance.
Joystick: The ergonomically designed joystick allows for comfortable and intuitive operation. It features a universal joint at the base for multi-directional movement and physical stops to prevent exceeding the safe range of motion for the control surfaces.
Linkages: Robust mechanical linkages, such as pushrods and bell cranks, connect the joystick to the rudders and fins, ensuring reliable and precise transmission of control inputs.
Control Surfaces: The submarine utilizes a combination of rudders for directional control (yaw) and diving planes for depth control (pitch). The design and size of these control surfaces are optimized for maneuverability and stability.
Design Considerations from eISR Rules:
Compliance with size and weight restrictions: The steering system design adheres to the eISR rules regarding submarine dimensions and weight distribution.
Pilot safety and accessibility: The system incorporates features like clearly marked emergency release mechanisms and easily accessible hatches to ensure pilot safety.
Material restrictions: The design avoids the use of prohibited materials, such as oil-based lubricants, and utilizes only water-resistant grease for lubrication.
